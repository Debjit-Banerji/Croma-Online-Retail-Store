# Croma-Online-Retail-Store
Fundamentals of Database Management Systems Course Project

Our project aims to build a database management system for Cromaâ€™s online retail store. Croma is a popular retail
store for electronics and other related consumer goods. Our database application will focus solely on its online
platform and exclude its offline stores from further discussions. This project's scope encompasses the management
of the products, user profiles, procurement of electronic goods from suppliers, and inventory. This project will
also aid in the administration of the distribution of the items, which includes the orders placed by the users and by
Croma for stock replenishment. Focusing solely on the online platform makes the database system
implementation precise and easily manageable. Separating back-end functions into distinct entities, like inventory,
distribution, and procurement, ensures a modular design, enhancing scalability.
